Tumblr Boilerplate
==================
The Tumblr Boilerplate (unofficial) is a fully automated approach to Tumblr theme development, providing some suggested content tags and scripts so you can concentrate on the *style*.

## Quick start

2. Clone the git repo: `git clone https://github.com/joejoinerr/tumblr-boilerplate.git`

## Features

- Posts loop in semantic `<article>` tags
- Common and useful `<meta>` tags
- Iterative `<title>` tag
- User variables
- OOCSS and BEM suggested class names
- Simple pagination links
- IDs on page sections for easy linking
- Bundled with [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/) and [html5shiv](https://code.google.com/p/html5shiv/) via [cdnjs](http://cdnjs.com)
