Tumblr Boilerplate
==================
The Tumblr Boilerplate (unofficial) is a fully automated approach to Tumblr theme development, providing some suggested content tags and scripts so you can concentrate on the *style*.

## Quick start
1. Download the zip archive: <https://github.com/joejoinerr/tumblr-boilerplate/archive/master.zip>
2. Clone the git repo: `git clone https://github.com/joejoinerr/tumblr-boilerplate.git`
3. Run `gulp build` to generate a static version of your theme, or `gulp dist` to generate the final code to paste into the Tumblr theme editor.

## Features
- Automatic concatenation, minification and moving external CSS to a `<style>` tag via [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com)
- Suggested markup for common post types
- Common and useful `<meta>` tags
- Iterative `<title>` tag
- User variables
- Multi-language support
- OOCSS and BEM suggested class names
- Simple pagination links
- Bundled with [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/) via [cdnjs](http://cdnjs.com)

Check out the [Tumblr theme docs](http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes) for information about specific variables or blocks.
